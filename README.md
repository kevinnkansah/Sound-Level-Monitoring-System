# Sound Level Monitoring System

## Project Overview
This project uses a Raspberry Pi and a microphone sensor to monitor ambient noise levels in real time. If the noise exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., 80 dB), the system sends an alert to a client device.

## Key Features
- Real-time sound level monitoring.
- UDP-based communication between Raspberry Pi (server) and client.
- Alert mechanism for high noise levels.

## Requirements
- Raspberry Pi with a microphone sensor.
- Python libraries: `sounddevice`, `numpy`, `socket`.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/khakanyiba/Sound-Level-Monitoring-System.git
